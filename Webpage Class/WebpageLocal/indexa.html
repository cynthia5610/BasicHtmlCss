				<h1> What did you learn? </h1>
				<p>I came in with knowledge about coding in html and css, however, I have still learned a lot about styling and formatting. I think overall the website looked pretty nice, but I think I could have worked on the structure of the web page a lot better. I did learn a lot about the techniques used to make the page look more appealing such as the thirds rule and proper sized spacing. Overall, this class did improve on how I make websites.</p>

				<h1> Design Techniques </h1>
				<p> Some design techniques that I used that worked well was finding a nice color palette as well as the accessibility and interactivity as well as fitting it with different display sizes. Somethings that I could work better is the fluid grid and the structure of the page. I also wished that I played with the sizes and font styles of the text.

				<h1>Accomplishments</h1>
				<p> What I am really proud of is the javascript part of showing and hiding the menu. I came in knowing how to code in html and css, but never touched javascript. I am also very proud of the javascript showing and hiding the "show/hide" button.

				<h1>Course Summary</h1>
				<p> Overall, I like this course a lot. The feedback given was nice and detailed as well as feedback from other peers. I think having more class participation/feedback discussions as well as a look into websites that show examples of each techniques that are useful.</p>
